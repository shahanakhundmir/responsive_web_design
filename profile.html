                        <h3>SHORT SUMMARY</h3>
                        <p>I started coding when I was around 11, using a BBC Basic computer hooked up to an old black &
                            white.<br>
                            We loaded our games from tapes and printed on a dot matrix that screeched everytime it moved
                            to the next line.<br>
                            We couldn't afford that computer, by chance we inherited it when a close friend emigrated
                            and left it behind.<br>
                            I learnt to code by copying from the back of the computer's user guide.<br>
                            When I was young not many girls coded, but I was pretty determined to do what I loved.<br>
                            <strong>So I believe that my journey was a lot of luck,<br>
                                a lot of being in the right place at the right time, <br>
                                but ...... that's how you get to the place that your meant to be.</strong>

                        <h3>MY EXPERIENCE</h3>
                        <p>I began my career as a Java programmer, working in application support.<br>
                            Leaving this when I had my kids, I spent the next five to six years working as a project
                            manager in community projects.<br>
                            Around five years ago, I set up <a
                                href='https://www.facebook.com/thecookieboxuk'><strong>The Cookie Box</strong></a> which
                            was my other passion of baking,<br>
                            But 18 months ago I decided to give a career in Tech another go.
                            Recently I worked for the charity sector on an analysis of funding to the BAME community
                            after Covid-19.</p>

                        <h3>TECHNICAL SKILLS</h3>
                        <p>My main language is Python, and I have focused on Python for data analysis, having done data
                            analysis pojects.My other languages and technical skills include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>HTML & CSS</li>
                            <li>SQL</li>
                            <li>Java (just a tiny bit)</li>
                            <li>Dash</li>
                            <li>Google Data Studio</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>And, I can run for the bus</strong></p>

                        <h3>Transferrable Skills</h3>
                        <p><strong>Organised.</strong></p>
                        <p>Having a big family, being organised has been my middle name. <strong>Diplomat</strong> is
                            probably another.<br>
                            I like to focus on projects and goals, and I was probably quite suited to my <strong>project
                                manager</strong> role.<br>
                            My business helped me to learn lot's of skills in time keeping and dealing with people and I
                            enjoyed meeting people from all walks of life.<br>

                        <h3>Gettting back to Tech</h3>
                        <p>It was August 2019 and I was at a cross-roads with my company & at the same time, my daughter
                            Jannah was embarking on her own journey into Tech.<br>
                            She <strong>dragged</strong> me to a Women in Tech event at IBM in Novemeber and we were the
                            last to leave.<br>
                            Inspired by the strong and talented women that I heard speaking, I decided to try coding
                            again.<br>
                            <strong>It began </strong>with a YouTube Python course, but I was quickly hooked.<br>
                            Within a few months I had closed my business and set out to learn Python with a view to
                            returning to Tech.
                        </p>
                        <p>Coding was something that I had always loved but convinced myself that I could not go back
                            to.<br>
                            Taking the first step is always the hardest, but if you do something you enjoy, the journey
                            becomes easy.<br>
